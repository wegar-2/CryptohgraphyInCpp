This is an instruction of how to compile a simple two-argument calculator.
The program consists of the following files:
	A. MultipleFilerProgram.cpp -- this cpp files contains include directive of the 
	   header file HelperFunctions.hpp 
	B. HelperFunctions.hpp --- header file with the declarations of the functions 
	   defined in the HelperFunctions.cpp file
	C. HelperFunctions.cpp -- file with the implementation of the functions declare in the
	   file HelperFunctions.hpp

The way to go about compiling this programs is the following:

	1. g++ -Wall -c HelperFunctions.cpp
	2. g++ -Wall -c MultipleFilesProgram.cpp
	3. g++ -Wall HelperFunctions.o MultipleFilesProgram.o -o ProgramFile

This means that one way to go is to first run the creation of object file on the compounding
.cpp files and then run the linking on the created object files.
